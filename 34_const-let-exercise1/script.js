/*
A CONSTANT EXERCISE OF LETTING VARIABLES BE VARIABLES

Imagine that you are building an application to manage a user's Facebook profile.
A profile might have a 'name, 'age' and 'dateOfBirth'.
Declare three variables with these same names, making sure to use 'const' or 'let' depending on wheter 
you expect the value to change over time.

const name = 'Jadon';
let age = 35;
const dateOfBirth = '21/05/1986';

console.log(name);
console.log(age);
console.log(dateOfBirth);
